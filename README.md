# hello-world
Just an initial repository for GitHub

Hello world, my name Mitchell and I am here to create this repository and readme on behalf of CS-HU250.
I am just a simple person who likes to code and explore things in various perspectives, whether that be in a real-life manner, virtual, or theoretical.
