## Atomic Force Microscopy

AFM is a type of scanning probe microscopy with very high resolution that is on the scale of nanometers, or fractions of nanometers. It works by scanning a small cantilever, which is a long projecting beam with a tip, over the surface of a smaple. The tip at the end of the cantilever makes contact with the surace, bending the cantilever and changing the amount of laser light reflected into the photodiode. The height of the cantilever is then adjusted to restore the response signal, resulting in the measures cantilever height tracing the surface of the sample.
